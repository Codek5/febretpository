              The first noticeable imperfection is right at the beginning of the sequence. Observing
              the car we can notice that shadows casted by the car on itself (A) are way darker and
              defined than the shadow casted by the car 
              <br />
              <img src="snap00002.jpg" style="float: right" width="500" />on the road (B). This may not
              be an acutal error, and may depend only on the choice of light positions. The effect
              still is quite weird, since the car gives the effect of being superimposed over
              the background. Also, the shading of wheels (C) seems to be inconsistent with respect
              to the shading of the rest of the car: wheel are shaded as light comes from a really
              low angle, while other parts of the car suggest the presence of a light source above
              the car itself.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              Another minor error can be noticed a little bit later in the animation (9.20).<img
                  src="snap00003.jpg" style="float: left" width="500" />
              In the following snapshot the bike front glass appears to be quite low-poly (A)
              if compared
              to the rest of the model. Also, the glass shows no refraction at all, and even no
              specular reflections as one would expect on this kind of material. Again this may
              be only due to the choice of light placing: still, one can't help but notice that
              the resulting effect fells unrealistic.<br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
                      The next series of frames is taken from a sequence that quite does the trick. A
                      rocket explodes right behind the bad guy,making him lose control of the car. You
                      can notice the quite good and curved smoke trail of the rocket before it hits the
                      terrain. The round movement of the rocket has just been underlined in a previous
                      sequence, with a nice camera movement following the rocket itself, so here the shape
                      of the trail gives a sense of consistency with the previous shot. Another good thing
                      about this sequence is the explosion itself. We'll see how in other points of the
                      animation particle systems will look quite weak. Here instead the generated effect
                      looks quite realistic. The explosion also emits light, as you can notice from the
                      brighter side of the car in (A). This also helps achieving a more credible effect
                      overall. The only flaw here, is in the car movement. The car is not going offroad
                      directly because of the explosion, but because of the bad guy abruptly steering
                      to the left (at least this is the effect the animation suggests). The problem is
                      that there is no time separation between the beginning of the explosion and of the
                      car steering. It looks like the driver is reacting <strong>immediately</strong>
                      to the explosion itself, which is quite unrealistic. One may argue that the bad
                      guy may have seen the rocket before the explosion, but in this case his action (steering)
                      would have been <strong>anticipated</strong> with respect to the explosion. Having
                      both the boom and the steering begin at the same time makes this particular sequence
                      a little bit mechanic.<h2>
                          <img src="seq6.jpg" style="font-weight: bold" width="700" />&nbsp;</h2>
              <p>
                  &nbsp;</p>
                      <p>
                  Now, look at this sequence:</p>
              <p>
                  <img src="seq2.jpg" width="700" />&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                  As you can see, it shows a close-up of the bad
              guy after his car has almost
                  been hit by a rocket. We can notice three flaws here:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The character expression is expected to communicate a mix of surprise and fear,
                      but the actual result is pretty bad. The overall effect is of an extremely 'syntetic'
                      result. Some exaggeration on the skin deformation, at least for some of the control
                      points, may have helped here.</li>
                  <li>The expression tends to be quite static along
              the entire closeup sequence. There
                      are some minor modifications over the skin deformation but they are quite subtle,
                      and they do not help avoiding the overall feeling of a freezed expression. &nbsp;</li><li>The skin material looks more like plastic than actual skin. It lacks detail, has
                      too much highlight and is definitely too smooth (i.e. there are no wrinkles on the
                      forehead). Creating realistic (and physically correct) skin models is a challenging
                      (and time consuming) task, but we can still notice that other characters
              present in this animation have more correct skin models. Probably less work has been adressed
                      to the character we are analyzing, since it is has been likely used only in this
                      sequence.</li>
