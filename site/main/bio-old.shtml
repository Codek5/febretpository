<h1>About Me</h1><br/>

<p>
Today, most research involves the analysis of scientific phenomena of
ever-increasing scale and complexity, and requires the concentrated effort
of interdisciplinary teams: scientists from different backgrounds whose work
involves large, heterogeneous data sources. As the scale and complexity of
data continue to grow, large scale visualization instruments like display
walls and immersive environments become increasingly essential to researchers.
In particular, immersive systems are an attractive option for exploring 3D
spatial data such as molecules, astrophysical phenomena, and geoscience datasets.
On the other hand, display walls with their high resolution help interpret
large datasets, offering both overview and resolution, or can be used to lay
out a variety of correlated visual data and documents for collaborative analysis.
</p>
<p>
The main goal of my research is to create novel tools that scientists can
leverage in their quest to turn raw data into discovery. To reach this goal,
I believe it is fundamental to interpret current technological trends, and
understand how they could facilitate the work and interaction dynamics of a
research team. For instance, advancements in display technology led to the
production of larger, affordable thin-bezel LCD monitors with built-in support
for stereoscopic 3D. These advancements made it conceivable to merge the
best-in-class capabilities of immersive Virtual Reality systems with the
best-in-class capabilities of Ultra-high-resolution Display Environments
thus creating conceptually new immersive environments which we refer to as
Hybrid Reality Environments (HREs), such as the CAVE2 system. These fully
digital ‘war rooms’ can support the simultaneous work of multiple users and
can work both as immersive environments and classic large displays.
Furthermore, we observed an explosion in the availability of powerful,
portable devices that represent a platform to both interact with a larger
system and enrich the capabilities of such system as an additional display device.
</p>
<p>
These hybrid multi-display and multi-user environments have been envisioned
in the past, but they are now reaching their full technological feasibility.
If we want to make full use of the capabilities of these systems, we need to
understand how users want to work and interact with them; we also need to
provide developers with a consistent software infrastructure that can be used
as a platform for applications on such systems.
</p>
<p>
I am addressing these challenges in my current research: I collaborated with
multidisciplinary teams interacting with large displays, and worked towards
a conceptual foundation and software infrastructure for co-located team work
in hybrid immersive environments. In particular, I observed how large display
users need access to a system that lets them easily and seamlessly manage
display space and content: co-located collaboration often entails multiple
phases that alternate full group work with individuals or sub-groups working
in parallel: moreover the work may focus on a single issue, on different
views into that single issue, or on independent issues:  the ability to
easily re-configure the display space is fundamental to support such heterogeneous tasks.
</p>
<p>
I envisioned the need for a convergence in software design for display walls
and immersive environments, proposing the integration of display wall software,
an immersive environment framework and additional components into an
"operating system" for Hybrid Reality Environments. This operating system
aims to solve two major challenges with alternative approaches:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Static allocation of 3D and 2D views:</i> although an HRE is capable
of displaying 2D and 3D content at the same time, software relies on
static configurations describing how the physical display space should
be split into 2D and 3D views. Multiple predefined configurations give
the end users some flexibility, but require restarting and resetting all
running applications.
</li>
<li>
<i>Lack of unified interaction:</i> the 2D and 3D portions on an HRE often
rely on inconsistent interaction schemes: for instance Pointing semantics
may use absolute movement on the 3D half and relative movement on the 2D
half. Physically separate interaction devices may be required. Or, when
a single device is used, interaction may lead to conflicting results
(i.e. navigating a 3D view moves 2D views).
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The remainder of my Ph.D. will be dedicated to completing the implementation
of the HRE operating system, working in particular on managing the interaction
between multiple users and multiple applications running on the system. I
plan to carry on a user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid
visualization and dynamic display configuration on a scientific visual
analysis task, and to further characterize the interaction patterns of a
small group of users with an HRE.
</p>
<p>
As a future research direction, I would like to further explore the use of
hybrid environments for collaborative visualization, both local and remote.
I see two main paths of advancement: HRE-to-HRE collaboration and cross-device,
or asymmetric, collaboration. The HRE-to-HRE scenario would involve two
remote teams working inside separate Hybrid Reality Environments, sharing
workspaces, views and applications between them. This work could make use
of the existing results in shared virtual environments, telepresence and
remote collaboration with display walls, but would need to merge concepts
from all three into a novel unified model. Cross-device collaboration is
exemplified by a team of users within an HRE, collaborating with one or more
remote users on mobile devices (i.e. tablets). In this scenario, collaboration
is asymmetric since the interaction and visualization capabilities are
radically different between the two user groups. A possible outcome of this
research would be a conceptual model for dynamically mapping views, workspaces
and interactions between the HRE and the mobile devices, in order to maximize
the collaboration bandwidth between the user groups. I believe large high
resolution displays are destined to become ubiquitous. Portable displays
already are. Making them part of a single ecosystem for scientific visualization
and collaboration can be a force multiplier for scientific discovery,
enabling researchers to better engage with their data and, more importantly,
with each other.
